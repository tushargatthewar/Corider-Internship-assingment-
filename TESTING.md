# Testing the Flask CRUD Application with Burp Suite

## Overview
This document provides a comprehensive guide on how to test the Flask CRUD application using Burp Suite. It covers the testing requirements, steps to perform CRUD operations, and how to include relevant screenshots.

## Requirements for Testing
To successfully test the Flask CRUD application with Burp Suite, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- **Burp Suite**: Download and install Burp Suite from [Burp Suite Official Site](https://portswigger.net/burp).

1. **Install Burp Suite**: Download the Community Edition or Professional version of Burp Suite.
2. **Configure Proxy Settings**:
   - Open Burp Suite and navigate to the "Proxy" tab.
   - Go to "Options" and set the proxy listener to `127.0.0.1:8080`.
3. **Configure Browser Proxy**:
   - Set your browserâ€™s proxy settings to use `127.0.0.1:8080`.

## Testing Steps
### Step 1: Capture Traffic
